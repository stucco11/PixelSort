# PixelSort

For those who don't know, PixelSorting is exactly what it sounds like: sorting pixels based on different criteria in a number of different ways. For instance, a script that does this would scrub through a photo line by line and then sort the pixels in the line based on different things, such as hue, luminosity, transparency, ect. For some examples of this, check out these scripts if you are so inclined:

PixelSorting is something that I've been interested in for a while, but I haven't yet found a program that has a convenient GUI to enable users a simple way to do these pixel sorts. I decided to just make one myself! This program is very much a work in progress, but I'm hoping to finish it quickly.
